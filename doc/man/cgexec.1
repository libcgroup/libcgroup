.SH NAME

cgexec \- run the task in given control groups

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcgexec\fR [\fB-h\fR] [\fB-g\fR <\fIcontrollers>:<path\fR>] [--sticky] \fBcommand\fR [\fIarguments\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcgexec\fR
program executes the task \fBcommand\fR
with arguments \fBarguments\fR in the given control groups.

.TP
.B -g <controllers>:<path>
defines the control groups in which the task will be run.
\fBcontrollers\fR is a list of controllers and
\fBpath\fR is the relative path to control groups
in the given controllers list.

This flag can be used multiple times to
define multiple pairs of lists of controllers
and relative paths.
Instead of the list of all mounted controllers,
the wildcard \fBb"*b"\fR can be used.

If this option is not used,
\fBcgexec\fR will automatically place the task in the right
cgroup based on \fB/etc/cgrules.conf\fR.

.TP
.B -h, --help
Display this help and exit.

.TP
.B --sticky
If running the task \fBcommand\fR with this option, the daemon of
service cgred (cgrulesengd process) does not change both the task
of the \fBcommand\fR and the child tasks. Without this option,
the daemon does not change the task of the \fBcommand\fR but it
changes the child tasks to the right cgroup based on
\fB/etc/cgrules.conf\fR automatically.
