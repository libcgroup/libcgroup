<p>This document outlines the steps to help you contribute to the libcgroup project. As with the libcgroup code itself, the process is a work in progress. Improvements and suggestions are welcome and encouraged.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
Interacting with the Community</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>&zwj;"When you are kind to others, it not only changes you, it changes the
world." - Harold Kushner </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The libcgroup project strives to be an inclusive and welcoming place. If you interact with the libcgroup project, we request that you treat others with dignity and respect. Failure to do so will result in a warning. In extreme cases, we reserve the right to block the individual from the project.</p>
<p>Examples of inappropriate behavior includes: profane, abusive, or prejudicial language directed at another person, vandalism (e.g. GitHub issue/PR "litter"), or spam.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Test Your Code Using Existing Tests</h1>
<p>The libcgroup project utilizes unit and functional tests. These tests must successfully pass prior to a commit being merged.</p>
<p>You can run both the unit and functional tests with the following command: </p><pre class="fragment"># make check
</pre><p> You can invoke only the unit tests with the following commands: </p><pre class="fragment"># cd tests/gunit
# make check
</pre><p> If there are unit test failures, running the unit tests outside of the automake framework will provide more information. </p><pre class="fragment"># cd tests/gunit
# ./gtest
</pre><p> You can invoke only the functional tests with the following commands: </p><pre class="fragment"># cd tests/ftests
# make check
</pre><p> Note that the functional tests can be run within a container or directly on your system. For the containerized tests, libcgroup utilizes LXC/LXD containers. If your system or distro doesn't support LXC/LXD, you can utilize the continuous integration infrastructure to test your changes. A successful continuous integration run is required for each pull request.</p>
<p>Many tests can also be run outside of a container. Use caution with these tests though, as they will modify your host's cgroup hierarchy. This could significantly and negatively affect your system.</p>
<p>We encourage utilizing a VM for libcgroup development work. The continuous integration suite utilizes the latest Ubuntu LTS.</p>
<p>To run the containerized tests only: </p><pre class="fragment"># cd tests/ftests
# ./ftests.sh
</pre><p> To run the non-containerized tests only: </p><pre class="fragment"># cd tests/ftests
# ./ftests-nocontainer.sh
</pre><p> After the run is complete, the ftests.sh.log and ftests-nocontainer.sh.log contain the full debug log for each run.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Add New Tests for New Functionality</h1>
<p>The libcgroup project utilizes automated tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to maintain a high level of code quality. Any pull requests that add functionality or significantly change existing code should include additional tests to verify the proper operation of the proposed changes. Note that functional tests are preferred over unit tests.</p>
<p>The continuous integration tools run the automated tests and automatically gather code coverage numbers. Pull requests that cause the code coverage numbers to decrease are strongly discouraged.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Explain Your Work</h1>
<p>At the top of every patch you should include a description of the problem you are trying to solve, how you solved it, and why you chose the solution you implemented. If you are submitting a bug fix, it is also incredibly helpful if you can describe/include a reproducer for the problem in the description as well as instructions on how to test for the bug and verify that it has been fixed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Sign Your Work</h1>
<p>The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the patch description, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The "Developer's Certificate of Origin" pledge is taken from the Linux Kernel and the rules are pretty simple: </p><pre class="fragment">Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
</pre><p> ... then you just add a line to the bottom of your patch description, with your real name, saying: </p><pre class="fragment">Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.example.org&gt;
</pre><p> You can add this to your commit description in <code>git</code> with <code>git commit -s</code></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Submitting Patches</h1>
<p>libcgroup was initially hosted on Sourceforge and at that time only accepted patches via the mailing list. In 2018, libcgroup was moved to github and now accepts patches via email or github pull request. Over time the libcgroup project will likely fully transition to gitub pull requests and issues.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Post Your Patches Upstream</h2>
<p>The sections below explain how to contribute via either method. Please read each step and perform all steps that apply to your chosen contribution method.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Submitting via Email</h2>
<p>Depending on how you decided to work with the libcgroup code base and what tools you are using there are different ways to generate your patch(es). However, regardless of what tools you use, you should always generate your patches using the "unified" diff/patch format and the patches should always apply to the libcgroup source tree using the following command from the top directory of the libcgroup sources: </p><pre class="fragment"># patch -p1 &lt; changes.patch
</pre><p> If you are not using git, stacked git (stgit), or some other tool which can generate patch files for you automatically, you may find the following command helpful in generating patches, where "libcgroup.orig/" is the unmodified source code directory and "libcgroup/" is the source code directory with your changes: </p><pre class="fragment"># diff -purN libcgroup.orig/ libcgroup/
</pre><p> When in doubt please generate your patch and try applying it to an unmodified copy of the libcgroup sources; if it fails for you, it will fail for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to email your patches to the mailing list so they can be reviewed and potentially merged into the main libcgroup repository. When sending patches to the mailing list it is important to send your email in text form, no HTML mail please, and ensure that your email client does not mangle your patches. It should be possible to save your raw email to disk and apply it directly to the libcgroup source code; if that fails then you likely have a problem with your email client. When in doubt try a test first by sending yourself an email with your patch and attempting to apply the emailed patch to the libcgrup repository; if it fails for you, it will fail for the rest of us trying to test your patch and include it in the main libcgroup repository.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Submitting via GitHub Pull Requests</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">this guide</a> if you've never done this before. </p>
